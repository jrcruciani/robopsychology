# Workshop preprint draft

> **Academic track — work in progress.** This is the formal write-up of the
> method. The practitioner-facing version lives in
> [the playbook](https://impermanente.es/robopsychology-playbook/). Validation
> studies (Cohen's κ on ratchet coherence, judge agreement across model
> families) are tracked in issues #8 and #10.

This directory contains the LaTeX source for the robopsychology
workshop preprint (repository issue
[#11](https://github.com/jrcruciani/robopsychology/issues/11)).

## Status

This is a **first scaffold**, not a submission-ready draft. Sections
are seeded with content derived from the repository's existing
markdown documents (`method.md`, `taxonomy.md`, `related-work.md`,
`validation/reproducible/*/analysis.md`, `README.md`) so the structure
is in place and reviewers can see the argument flow. Places that
require original authorial writing or numbers from runs that haven't
been executed yet are flagged with `\todo{...}` blocks inside the
source.

`\todo{...}` blocks render in red so they're visible in the compiled
PDF and easy to grep for in the source.

```

## Build

The draft uses generic LaTeX so it compiles without venue-specific
style files:

```bash
cd paper/
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex   main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

Or with `latexmk`:

```bash
cd paper/
latexmk -pdf main.tex
```

The output is `main.pdf` (~8 pages + appendix once `\todo` blocks
are resolved).

## Target venue

In order of fit (per issue #11):

1. **NeurIPS SafetyML workshop** — behavioral evals with measurable rigor.
2. **ICLR BlogTrack** — if framed as methodology + case studies.
3. **ACL RepL4NLP** — interpretability / representation angle.
4. **HEAL workshop** — practitioner-diagnosis angle.

Swap `main.tex`'s preamble for the venue-specific style file
(e.g. `neurips_2026.sty` or `iclr2026_conference.sty`) once selected.

## Outstanding work before submission

Blocking work, in order of dependency:

1. **Issue #10 (score distributions, $N$ runs).** Replace the
   single-run point estimates in `sections/05-validation.tex` with
   $\bar{x} \pm s$ over $N \geq 5$ runs per case (and $N=10$ for
   Case~3). The infrastructure (`--runs N` flag, `distribution.json`
   aggregation) is implemented; what's missing is the actual API
   spend.

2. **Issue #8 (cross-family judges).** Re-run the Case~3 transcript
   through GPT-5 and Gemini judges to get full three-judge agreement.
   The script (`validation/reproducible/cross_judge_case03.py`) is in
   place; opus has already run cleanly. GPT-5 and Gemini are blocked
   on API access.

Non-blocking work (`\todo{...}` in the source):

3. Inline the final per-case numbers (overall confidence, ratchet
   coherence, etc.) once the $N$-run aggregates are available.
4. Add the architecture diagram figure to `figures/architecture.pdf`.
5. Inline the verbatim YAML prompt text for the four key probes in
   appendix A.
6. Pick five-to-eight high-signal transcript excerpts per case for
   appendix B.
7. Extract the three code snippets for appendix C.
8. Write the acknowledgments section (last 4 lines of
   `07-future-work.tex`).

## arXiv submission

Once the `\todo` blocks above are resolved and the paper compiles
cleanly:

```bash
cd paper/
latexmk -pdf main.tex
# create a self-contained tarball for arXiv:
tar czf arxiv-submission.tar.gz \
    main.tex bibliography.bib main.bbl \
    sections/ appendix/ figures/
```

Then submit to arXiv under `cs.CL` or `cs.AI`. Update the root
`README.md`'s Citation section with the resulting arXiv ID
(replacing the current GitHub-only placeholder citation).
